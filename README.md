# DS4003-Assignment5-Callbacks

I could not, for the life of me, get my app to deploy in render, the error messages aren't helpful either. My app is 100% functional, just not deployed in render unfortunately. I copied over the requirements.txt file we used in the demo, and I remained my .ipynb file with my app to app.py, this one also included the data, which I copied over into my Github. Not sure what I am missing.
